### Hi there 👋

I’m a Software Engineer passionate about the open web, javascript and internet privacy. I love working on challenging problems and shipping products.

I’m currently working as the sole Front End engineer who builds the [ReaQta's](https://reaqta.com/) website and main product for endpoint threat response dashboard with React and Node.js. So, I work closely with other engineers, malware researchers and UX designers to make sure our products are fixing the right problems.
